			<h2>Takeoff!</h2>

			<p>
				Hello there! Welcome to a brand new adventure. I'll assume you've already visited the about page to know the basics about me, so I'll dive a bit into what I left out, and a quick point out on why would this blog exists. 
			</p>
			<p>
				You already know, my name is Francisco, I'm 27, from Argentina, and even though I have a degree on graphic design, I have a hard time defining what I do. Coming up with a short description is always kind of tricky, if you met me in person you would see me struggle when saying "hi, I'm Fran, I'm a designer and… many other things actually". The thing is, there's actually three areas that I absolutely love: design, technology, and teaching. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I would be absolutely happy in a job that allows me to combine those three. In a way, that's how I got into UX design. I like designing, I also like very much coding, but the thing I like the most is being able to look at the entire picture. Being a website, an app, or whatever project it is, I like thinking about design and production as one thing. Maybe not executed by the same people, but definitely with the same goals. That's when I get into User Experience, that's when I can spend hours thinking and testing the way something is actually used, the way you interact with it, what you can do with it, etc. 
			</p>
			<p>
				So, why does this blog exist? Well, I guess ideas you don't use are ideas you end up loosing in the long run, so this is going to be a repository for those ideas. Mainly, I'll have three topics: user experience, design and teaching, the three things that I like doing the most. Some may be quite short, just a hint of an idea, others may be more elaborate theories. Who will read them? Well, I have no idea. Like the Internet itself, I welcome everyone who would like to have a read. And if you liked or haver what you see here, please feel welcome to write me about it. 
			</p>

			<p>
				For now, that's it, I hope you do come back, I will be trying to post something new every week or two depending on the topic and, let's be honest, how much time I have available. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Until next time, <br/>
				Laters!
			</p>

			<br/>
			<br/>
			<br/>
			<br/>

			<p>
				Ps: this is the first upload of my website, it has many rough edges, but I'll be taking care of those along the way. I know the website doesn't display properly on internet explorer, and I will try to patch that up at some point in the future, but in the mean time, why don't you try a more modern browser? ^^
